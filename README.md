# Miscellaneous-scripts
As the name suggest, these are miscellaneous scripts I have written to help with certain tasks encountered when working with sequencing data.

rename_sra_files.py - Given a tab-delimited file associating SRA run names with sample names, this script renames downloaded files by their sample names.

test_figaro.sh - Use this script to test your installation of FIGARO after following the installation instrucions at https://john-quensen.com/tutorials/figaro/.
